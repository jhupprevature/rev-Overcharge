# Rev-Overcharge
Project 3 for 210607 Reston Batch 1070.

## Project Description

Revature Overcharge is a full-stack web application. It is a study system for Revature employees. Users of the application will be able to create their own flashcard sets and use flashcard sets created by other users to study. When running through a flashcard set a user will be able to type an answer before viewing the answer to a flashcard, giving them the ability to compare their answer with the real one. Flashcards can be marked as studied to prevent requestioning. Flashcard sets can be rated. A timer is also provided to coordinate study and break sessions. Daily and weekly objectives are measured to award points to users.
